# Workflow

The broad workflow look like this:

1. Initialize your project
2. Write documentation in the Markdown files
3. Generate web-based docs from the Markdown
4. Change your source code
5. Re-generate Markdown
6. GOTO 2

These steps correspond to these commands:

1. `doxidize init`
2. ...
3. `doxidize build`
4. ...
5. `doxidize update`
6. ...

The `...` steps depend on your editor. For more details, please
consult the pages on each of these subcommands.
